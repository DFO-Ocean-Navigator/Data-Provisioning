`riopsWeighted.sh` is a script to conglomerate and normalize riops files into 3h averages so that `riopsMonthly.sh` can quickly make monthly averages. The input directories of `riopsWeighted.sh` should be any location where RIOPS files are being pulled down. The input directory of `riopsMonthly.sh` should be the output of `riopsWerighted.sh`. They should be run on the first of every month, or right after the last data from the previous month is pulled down.

These scripts can be easily modified to only look for a specific year by specifying "YYYY" at the beginning of the name pattern for the find commands near the beginning of both scripts.
